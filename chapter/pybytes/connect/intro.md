Select how you would like to connect your device to Pybytes:
1. [CONNECT YOUR DEVICE *QUICKLY (RECOMMENDED)*](quick.md)
2. [CONNECT YOUR DEVICE *BY FLASHING PYBYTES LIBRARY*](flash.md)

{% hint style='info' %}
From firmware 1.16.x onwards all Pycom devices come with Pybytes library build-in `/frozen` folder.
That means that you can choose between adding your device quickly with the firmware updater or you can flash Pybytes library manually.
