The universal OEM reference board is a reference design suitable W01, L01, L04
and G01 OEM modules, making it possible to have a single PCB design that can
accommodate all our OEM modules.

{% hint style='info' %}
If you require a reference board for the G01, only this design is suitable. The
L01 reference board does not contain the necessary SIM slot.
